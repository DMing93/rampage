# RAMpage

This repository contains the RAMpage online memory tester for Linux, which we
developed on the basis of
[Jens Neuhalfen's memtester](https://github.com/neuhalje/kernel-memtest).
A detailed description, and measurements on both effectiveness and efficiency,
can be found in the following two publications:

* H. Schirmeier, J. Neuhalfen, I. Korb, O. Spinczyk, and M. Engel.
  [RAMpage: Graceful degradation management for memory errors in commodity
  Linux servers](http://danceos.org/publications/PRDC-2011-Schirmeier.pdf).
  In *Proceedings of the 17th IEEE Pacific Rim International Symposium on
  Dependable Computing (PRDC '11)*, pages 89-98, Pasadena, CA, USA, Dec. 2011.
