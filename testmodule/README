Quick & Dirty testing hack based on copied rampage kernal module:
- allocates a memory block on load (and frees it on unload)
- attempts to claim PFNs from within that block are accepted
- attempts to claim anything else are rejected
- attempts to mark a page as bad are ignored

Should be a safer alternative to the "real" module to test changes in the
userspace component and works with a vanilla kernel.
